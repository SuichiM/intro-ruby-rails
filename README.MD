# intro to ruby and rails

this is a autolearning tutorial for to get in touch with ruby and rails.

first of all I generate a docker-compose following (not strictly [docker tutorial for rails](https://docs.docker.com/samples/rails/))

after that we have a fresh installation of a ruby running in a service called `web` and other for a `postgres` database, running `CMD ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]` for keep the container up and running ;).

## starting with rails

after that we started to follow this [tutorial](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.2/getting_started.html)

1. installing rails `gem install rails` check the install with `rails --version`

2. creating the app `rails new blog --database=postgresql` This will create a Rails application called `Blog` in a `blog` directory and install the gem dependencies that are already mentioned in `Gemfile` using bundle install.

> You can see all of the command line options that the Rails application builder accepts by running `rails new -h`

3. run this command to get ownership of the folder

```
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
```

4. at this point we need to configure our postgres database for the project. go to `config/database.yml` and

```yml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  host: db
  username: postgres
  password: password
  pool: 5

development:
  <<: *default
  database: myapp_development

test:
  <<: *default
  database: myapp_test
```

5. create and migrate the db

```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

6. run `bin/rails server -b '0.0.0.0'`

## controllers

To create a new controller, you will need to run the "controller" generator and tell it you want a controller called "Welcome" with an action called "index", just like this:

```
bin/rails generate controller Welcome index
```

## routes

Open the file `config/routes.rb` in your editor. that file tells Rails how to connect incoming requests to controllers and actions.

```rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'welcome/index'

  root 'welcome#index'
end
```

root `'welcome#index'` tells Rails to map requests to the root of the application to the welcome controller's `index` action and `get` 'welcome/index' tells Rails to map requests to `http://localhost:3000/welcome/index` to the welcome controller's index action.

## models / resources

A resource is the term used for a collection of similar objects, such as articles, people or animals. You can create, read, update and destroy items for a resource and these operations are referred to as CRUD operations.

Rails provides a `resources method` which can be used to declare a standard REST resource.

You need to add the article resource to the config/routes.rb so the file will look as follows:

```rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'welcome/index'

  resources :articles

  root 'welcome#index'
end
```

you can check that by running

```
bin/rails routes
```

## giving behavior to the resource's routes

after adding resources to our route file, rails exposes a serie of routes for the CRUD of it.

but for handle them, we must create a controller to map between the routes created and actions

so we will create a new controller to handle the `articles` resource

```
bin/rails generate controller Articles
```

now we must define the `new` method that will handle te new request

```rb
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def new
  end
end
```

calling this method we must response an a response always must have a template that will says how parse the response.
all the templates are located under the `app/views` folder

we can response

> html -> with files `.html.erb`
>
> xml -> with files `.builder`
>
> js -> with files `.coffe`

## form builder

To create a form within this template, you will use a form builder. The primary form builder for Rails is provided by a helper method called `form_with`.

```erb
<%= form_with scope: :article, url: articles_path, local: true do |form| %>
  <p>
    <%= form.label :title %><br>
    <%= form.text_field :title %>
  </p>

  <p>
    <%= form.label :text %><br>
    <%= form.text_area :text %>
  </p>

  <p>
    <%= form.submit %>
  </p>
<% end %>
```

the form will send by default, a `post` action, and will post to the `url` that in this case is the route defined for the articles resources.

now in the controller we must handle the submitted data.

```
def create
  render plain: params[:article].inspect
end
```

## creating an article the model

for create a model we must run the a command as follow

```
bin/rails generate model Article title:string text:text
```

once created a model, we must run the migration to impact changes on the database

```
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## securing the creation of the model

for security reason, to create a new model isntance, we must define the allowed fields.

so We have to whitelist our controller parameters to prevent wrongful mass assignment. In this case, we want to both allow and require the title and text parameters for valid use of create. The syntax for this introduces require and permit. The change will involve one line in the create action:

```rb
def create
  @article = Article.new(article_params)

  @article.save
  redirect_to @article
end

private
  def article_params
    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)
  end
```

> A frequent practice is to place the standard CRUD actions in each controller in the following order: index, show, new, edit, create, update and destroy. You may use any order you choose, but keep in mind that these are public methods; as mentioned earlier in this guide, they must be placed before declaring private visibility in the controller.

## model validation, models in deep

The model file, `app/models/article.rb` is about as simple as it can get:

There isn't much to this file - but note that the `Article` class inherits from `ApplicationRecord`. `ApplicationRecord` inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base` which supplies a great deal of functionality to your Rails models for free, including:

- basic database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) operations,
- data validation,
- as well as sophisticated search support and
- the ability to relate multiple models to one another.

Rails includes methods to help you validate the data that you send to models.

Open the `app/models/article.rb` file and edit it:

```rb
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true,
                    length: { minimum: 5 }
end
```

These changes will ensure that all articles have a `title` that is at least five characters long.
Rails can validate a variety of conditions in a model, including the presence or uniqueness of columns, their format, and the existence of associated objects.
Validations are covered in detail in [Active Record Validations](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.2/active_record_validations.html).

## updating a resource

first of all we must search the resource to update, so we define a edit method, that will search the resource and make it available for the view to render.

```rb
def edit
  @article = Article.find(params[:id])
end
```

in the view, as we said before we have the `form_with` helper. The arguments to `form_with`

- could be model objects, say, model: @article which would cause the helper to fill in the form with the fields of the object.
- Passing in a symbol scope (scope: :article) just creates the fields but without anything filled into them. More details can be found in form_with [documentation](http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.6/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-form_with).
